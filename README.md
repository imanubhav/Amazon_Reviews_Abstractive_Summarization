# Amazon_Reviews_Abstractive_Summarization
Abstractive Text Summarization Using Seq2Seq Model,BERT,RobertA,T5
The objective of this project is that we can summarize the summary of the review written for Amazon
to find food. In this project, we create an automatic
text summarizer with the help of abstract methods
of text summarization and summarize the review
for Amazon’s fine food.
We used a review text description of Amazon’s fine
food as the input data and generated the shorter
summary of the reviews as the output. Formally we
have n-word input sequences come from a set of
the vocabulary of size V as a X1 . . . XN . We want
to get an output of a shorter sequence of Y1 . . . YM
where M < N where y is the essence of x. We
assume all the subsequences Y1 . . . YM are coming
from the same vocabulary set V
